Deploying Arvados in Docker Containers
======================================

This file explains how to build and deploy Arvados servers in Docker
containers, so that they can be run easily in different environments
(a dedicated server, a developer's laptop, a virtual machine,
etc).

This is a work in progress; instructions will almost certainly be
incomplete and possibly out of date.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

* Docker

  Docker is a Linux container management system based on LXC. It is a
  very young system but is being developed rapidly.  See
  http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation for an
  installation package for your platform.

* Ruby (any version)

BUILDING
--------

1. Before building, edit config.yml with settings for your
   installation.

2. Run `./config.rb' to generate configuration files.

3. Add a DNS entry for your API_HOSTNAME which resolves to the machine
   that the API container will be deployed to.

4. Provision your Omniauth server with the APP_ID and
   APP_SECRET from api/omniauth.rb.

5. Run `./build.sh' to build the following Docker images:

     arvados/api    - the Arvados API server
     arvados/keep   - Keep, the Arvados content-addressable filesystem
     arvados/crunch - Crunch, a compute node for Arvados
