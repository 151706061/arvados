package replicator

/* The Keep replicator package fulfills replication pull requests sent
   by Data Manager.

   The interface is:

   replicator.New() launches a replication goroutine and returns the
   new Replicator object.

   replicator.SetList() assigns a new pull list to the goroutine. Any
   existing list is discarded.

   replicator.GetList() reports the goroutine's current pull list.

   replicator.Close() shuts down the replicator.
