== Arvados Java SDK

  - Using the Arvados Java SDK, you can access API server from a java program.

  - Please refer to http://doc.arvados.org/api/index.html for a complete list
    of supported resources and methods.

  - This document highlights the details as to how to use the SDK.

  - The Java SDK is used as a maven project. Hence, you would need a working
      maven environment to be able to build the source code.

      If you do not have maven setup, you may find the following link useful.

      http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

  - In this document <ARVADOS_HOME> is used to refer to the directory where
      arvados code is cloned in your system.
      For ex: <ARVADOS_HOME> = $HOME/arvados


== Setting up the environment

  - The SDK requires a running Arvados API server. The information about the
  	  API server needs to be passed to the SDK using environment variables.
  	  
  - The following two environment variables are required by the SDK

      ARVADOS_API_TOKEN, ARVADOS_API_HOST
      
      Below are examples using a .bashrc file:
      
      	export ARVADOS_API_TOKEN=z40gplmla6i58rsg96jhg5u41ewdl5rj4g1py2xg6s6e2lsc3
		export ARVADOS_API_HOST=localhost:3001
      
  - You can also set ARVADOS_API_HOST_INSECURE to true if you are using
  	  self-signed certificates and want to bypass certificate validations.

      Below is an example using a .bashrc file:
      
      	export ARVADOS_API_HOST_INSECURE=true
      	

== Building the Arvados SDK

  - cd <ARVADOS_HOME/sdk/java

  - mvn clean package

      This will generate arvados sdk jar file in the target directory


== Implementing your code to use SDK

  - <ARVADOS_HOME>/sdk/java/ArvadosSDKJavaExample.java serves as an example
      implementation using the java SDK. Please use this file to see how
      you would want use the SDK from your java program.
      The steps below use this java class name.

  - ArvadosSDKJavaExample.java creates an instance of Arvados SDK class and
      uses it to make various "call" requests.

  - To compile ArvadosSDKJavaExample.java

      javac -cp <ARVADOS_HOME>/sdk/java/target/arvados-sdk-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ArvadosSDKJavaExample.java

      This results in the generation of the ArvadosSDKJavaExample.class file
        in the same directory as the java file

  - To run the class file

      java -cp .:<ARVADOS_HOME>/sdk/java/target/arvados-sdk-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ArvadosSDKJavaExample


== Viewing and managing SDK logging

  - SDK uses log4j logging

  - The default location of the log file is
      <ARVADOS_HOME>/sdk/java/log/arvados_sdk_java.log

  - Update log4j.properties file to change name and location of the log file.

      Modify the "log4j.appender.fileAppender.File" property in log4j.properties
        file located at <ARVADOS_HOME>/sdk/java/src/main/resources

      Rebuild by running "mvn clean package"


== Using the SDK in eclipse

  - To develop in eclipse, you can use the SDK eclipse project.

  - Install "m2eclipse" plugin in your eclipse

  - Open the SDK project.

      File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Next -> Browse
          and select <ARVADOS_HOME>/sdk/java
