Arvados can be installed in multiple ways. Arvados does not depend on any particular cloud operating stack. Arvados runs on one or more GNU/Linux system(s). Arvados is being developed on Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

The simplest way to try out Arvados is to use the "Docker-based installation":install-docker.html, which installs Arvados in a series of Docker containers.

For production use or evaluation at scale, a "Manual Installation":install-manual-overview.html is more appropriate.
