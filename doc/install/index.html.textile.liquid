Arvados can be installed in multiple ways. Arvados does not depend on any particular cloud operating stack. Arvados runs on one or more GNU/Linux system(s). Arvados is being developed on Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

The simplest way to try out Arvados is to use the Docker-based installation, which installs Arvados in a series of Docker containers.

For larger scale installations, a manual installation is more appropriate.
