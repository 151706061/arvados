Arvados components run on GNU/Linux systems, and do not depend on any particular cloud operating stack. It is developed primarily on Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

Arvados components can be installed and configured in a number of different ways. Step-by-step instructions are available for a few specific installation methods: 
* "Install pre-built docker images":pre-built-docker.html *(quickest)*
* "Build your own docker images":install-docker.html (from source)
* "Manual installation":install-manual-prerequisites.html (most flexible)

For local evaluation and testing on a single computer, use one of the docker installation methods.

For production use or evaluation at scale, the "manual installation":install-manual-prerequisites.html is more appropriate. This method assumes you have a number of (virtual) machines at your disposal for running the various Arvados components.
