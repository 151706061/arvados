# API authentication

Open a browser and point it to the Workbench URL for your site. It
will look something like this:

`https://workbench.a123z.arvados.org/`

Log in, if you haven't done that already.

Click the "API tokens" link.

Copy an API token and set an environment variable in your terminal
session like this.

    export ARVADOS_API_TOKEN=unvz7ktg5p5k2q4wb9hpfl9fkge96rvv1j1gjpiq
