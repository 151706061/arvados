h1. Tutorial 1: Using the "arv" command

This tutorial introduces the @arv@ command line tool and demonstrates how to run a simple script.

This tutorial assumes that you are logged into an Arvados VM instance, as described in "accessing arvados over ssh":#login

h2. Checking your environment

Check that you are able to access the Arvados API server using the following command:

<pre>
$ arv user current
</pre>

If you receive the message "ARVADOS_API_HOST and ARVADOS_API_TOKEN need to be defined as environment variables", follow the instructions "Getting an API token":api-tokens.html , then return to this document.

If @arv user current@ is able to access the API server, it will print out the unique identifier associated with your account:

<pre>
qr1hi-xioed-9z2p3pn12yqdaem
</pre>

This unique identifier represents your identity in the Arvados system and is similar to the concept of a pointer or a foreign key.  You may de-reference any identifier returned by the "arv" command using the @-h@ command line option.  For example:

<pre>
$ arv -h user current
{
 "href":"https://qr1hi.arvadosapi.com/arvados/v1/users/qr1hi-xioed-9z2p3pn12yqdaem",
 "kind":"arvados#user",
 "etag":"8u0xwb9f3otb2xx9hto4wyo03",
 "uuid":"qr1hi-tpzed-92d3kxnimy3d4e8",
 "owner_uuid":"qr1hi-tpqed-23iddeohxta2r59",
 "created_at":"2013-12-02T17:05:47Z",
 "modified_by_client_uuid":"qr1hi-xxfg8-owxa2oa2s33jyej",
 "modified_by_user_uuid":"qr1hi-tpqed-23iddeohxta2r59",
 "modified_at":"2013-12-02T17:07:08Z",
 "updated_at":"2013-12-05T19:51:08Z",
 "email":"you@example.com",
 "full_name":"Example User",
 "first_name":"Example",
 "last_name":"User",
 "identity_url":"https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawnhlZr-pQ_Ic2f2W22XaO02oL3avJ322k1",
 "is_active": true,
 "is_admin": false,
 "prefs":{}
}
</pre>

h2. Submitting your first job

We will run the "hash" program, which computes the MD5 hash of each file in a collection.

Pick a data collection. We'll use @33a9f3842b01ea3fdf27cc582f5ea2af@ here.

_How do I know if I have this data?  Does it come as example data with
the arvados distribution?  Is there something notable about it, like
it is very large and spans multiple keep blocks?_

<pre>
the_collection=33a9f3842b01ea3fdf27cc582f5ea2af
</pre>

Pick a code version. We'll use @5565778cf15ae9af22ad392053430213e9016631@ here.

_How do I know if I have this code version?  What does this refer to?
A git revision?  Or a keep id?  In what repository?_

<pre>
the_version=5565778cf15ae9af22ad392053430213e9016631
</pre>

Make a JSON object describing the job.

<pre>
read -rd $'\000' the_job <<EOF
{
 "script":"hash",
 "script_version":"$the_version",
 "script_parameters":
 {
  "input":"$the_collection"
 }
}
EOF
</pre>

_Need to explain what the json fields mean, it is explained later but
there should be some mention up here._

(The @read -rd $'\000'@ part uses a bash feature to help us get a
multi-line string with lots of double quotation marks into a shell
variable.)

Submit the job.

<pre>
arv -h job create --job "$the_job"
</pre>

&darr;

<pre>
{
 "kind":"arvados#job",
 "etag":"dwbrasqcozpjsqtfshzdjfiii",
 "uuid":"qr1hi-8i9sb-3i0yi357k0mauwz",
...
 "script":"hash",
 "script_parameters":{
  "input":"33a9f3842b01ea3fdf27cc582f5ea2af"
 },
 "script_version":"5565778cf15ae9af22ad392053430213e9016631",
...
}
</pre>

_What is this?  An example of what "arv" returns?  What do the fields mean?_

h3. Monitor job progress

_And then the magic happens.  There should be some more discussion of what
is going on in the background once the job is submitted from the
user's perspective.  It is queued, running, etc?._

Go to Workbench, drop down the Compute menu, and click Jobs. The job you submitted should appear at the top of the list.

Hit "Refresh" until it finishes.  _We should really make the page
autorefresh or use a streamed-update framework_

You can also watch the log messages while the job runs:

<pre>
curl -s -H "Authorization: OAuth2 $ARVADOS_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://$ARVADOS_API_HOST/arvados/v1/jobs/JOB_UUID_HERE/log_tail_follow"
</pre>

This will run until the job finishes or you hit control-C.

If you're running more than one job today, you can watch log messages from all of them in one stream:

<pre>
my_user_uuid=`arv user current`
curl -s -H "Authorization: OAuth2 $ARVADOS_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://$ARVADOS_API_HOST/arvados/v1/users/$my_user_uuid/event_stream"
</pre>

This will run until you hit control-C.

h3. Inspect the job output

Find the output of the job by looking at the Jobs page (in the Compute menu) in Workbench, or by using the API:

<pre>
arv -h job get --uuid JOB_UUID_HERE
</pre>

The output locator will look like <code>5894dfae5d6d8edf135f0ea3dba849c2+62+K@qr1hi</code>.

List the files in the collection:

<pre>
arv keep ls 5894dfae5d6d8edf135f0ea3dba849c2+62+K@qr1hi
</pre>

&darr;

<pre>
md5sum.txt
</pre>

Show the contents of the md5sum.txt file:

<pre>
arv keep less 5894dfae5d6d8edf135f0ea3dba849c2+62+K@qr1hi/md5sum.txt
</pre>

h3. Inspect the code

The @script@ and @script_version@ attributes of a Job allow you to confirm the code that was used to run the job. Specifically, @script@ refers to a file in the @/crunch_scripts@ directory in the tree indicated by the commit hash @script_version@.

Example:

<pre>
cd
git clone git://github.com/clinicalfuture/arvados.git
cd arvados
git checkout $the_version
less crunch_scripts/hash
</pre>

_If we're going to direct the user to open up the code, some
discussion of the python API is probably in order.  If the hash
job is going to be the canonical first crunch map reduce program
for everybody, than we should break down the program line-by-line and
explain every step in detail._
