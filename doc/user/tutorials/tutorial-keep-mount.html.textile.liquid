title: "Mounting Keep as a filesystem"
...

This tutoral describes how to use @arv-mount@ to mount Keep as a read-only file system access it using traditional filesystem tools.

@arv-mount@ provides several features:

* You can browse, open and read Keep entries as if they are regular files.
* It is easy for existing tools to access files in Keep.
* Data is downloaded on demand.  It is not necessary to download an entire file or collection to start processing.

{% include 'tutorial_expectations' %}

The default mode permits browsing any collection in Arvados as a subdirectory under the mount directory.  To avoid having to fetch a potentially very large list of all collections, collection directories only come into existence when explicitly accessed by their keep locator.
