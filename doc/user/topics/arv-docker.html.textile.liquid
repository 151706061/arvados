h1. Docker

Arvados uses "Docker":https://www.docker.com/ images to provide a runtime environment for Crunch jobs.

This page will demonstrate how to build the arvados/jobs Docker image, manually install additional software into the image to create a new custom image, and upload that image to Arvados for use by Crunch jobs.

Arvados images are based on "Debian.":https://debian.org  In order to build

cd ~/arvados/docker
./build.sh jobs-image
