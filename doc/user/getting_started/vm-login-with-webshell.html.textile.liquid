This document describes how to access an Arvados VM with Webshell from Workbench.

h2(#webshell). Access VM using webshell

Accessing VM using webshell requires no prior setup by the user such as setting up SSH keys.

In the Arvados Workbench, click on the dropdown menu icon <span class="fa fa-lg fa-user"></span> <span class="caret"></span> in the upper right corner of the top navigation menu to access the user settings menu, and click on the menu item *Manage account* to go to the account management page. In the *Manage account* page, you will see the *Virtual Machines* panel that lists the virtual machines you can access.

Each row in the Virtual Machines panel lists the hostname of the VM, along with a *<code>Log in as *you*</code>* button under the column "Web shell beta". Clinking on this button will open up a webshell terminal for you in a new browser tab and log you in.
