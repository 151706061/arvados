h1. Jobs

Applications submit compute jobs when:
* Provenance is important, i.e., it is worth recording how the output was produced; or
* Computation time is significant; or
* The job management features are convenient (failure detection/recovery, regression testing, etc).

h2. Methods

See "REST methods for working with Arvados resources":methods.html

API endpoint base: @https://xyzzy.arvados.org/arvados/v1/jobs@
