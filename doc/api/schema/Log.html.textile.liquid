**Log** objects record events that occur in an Arvados cluster. Both user-written pipelines and the Arvados system itself may generate Log events.

h2. Methods

See "REST methods for working with Arvados resources":/api/methods.html

API endpoint base: @https://{{ site.arvados_api_host }}/arvados/v1/logs@

h2. Creation

Any user may create Log entries for any event they find useful. User-generated Logs have no intrinsic meaning to other users or to the Arvados system itself; it is up to each user to choose appropriate log event types and summaries for their project.

h3. System Logs

At the time of this writing, the Arvados system uses Logs only to record interactive user shell logins (event type @LOGIN@).

h2. Resources

Each Log has, in addition to the usual "attributes of Arvados resources":/api/resources.html:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Attribute|_. Type|_. Description|_. Example|
|object_kind|string|||
|object_uuid|string|||
|event_at|datetime|||
|event_type|string|A user-defined category or type for this event.|@LOGIN@|
|summary|text|||
|info|Hash|||
|updated_at|datetime|||
