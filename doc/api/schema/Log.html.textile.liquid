...

**Log** objects record events that occur in an Arvados cluster. Both user-written pipelines and the Arvados system itself may generate Log events.

h2. Methods

See "logs":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods/logs.html

h2. Creation

Any user may create Log entries for any event they find useful. User-generated Logs have no intrinsic meaning to other users or to the Arvados system itself; it is up to each user to choose appropriate log event types and summaries for their project.

h3. System Logs

Arvados uses Logs to record creation, deletion, and updates of other Arvados resources.

h2. Resource

Each Log has, in addition to the usual "attributes of Arvados resources":{{site.baseurl}}/api/resources.html:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Attribute|_. Type|_. Description|_. Example|
|object_uuid|string|||
|event_at|datetime|||
|event_type|string|A user-defined category or type for this event.|@LOGIN@|
|summary|text|||
|properties|hash|||
