...

Note: This resource concerns indexing, usage accounting, and integrity checks for data stored in Arvados. Reading and writing the data _per se_ is achieved by the "Keep":{{site.baseurl}}/user/tutorials/tutorial-keep.html storage system.

h2. Methods

See "collections":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods/collections.html

h3. Conditions of creating a Collection

The @uuid@ and @manifest_text@ attributes must be provided when creating a Collection. The cryptographic digest of the supplied @manifest_text@ must match the supplied @uuid@.

h3. Side effects of creating a Collection

Referenced data can be protected from garbage collection. See the section about "resources" links on the "Links":Link.html page.

Data can be shared with other users via the Arvados permission model.

Clients can request checks of data integrity and storage redundancy.

h2. Resource

Each collection has, in addition to the usual "attributes of Arvados resources":{{site.baseurl}}/api/resources.html:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Attribute|_. Type|_. Description|_. Example|
|name|string|||
|description|text|||
|portable_data_hash|string|||
|manifest_text|text|||
|replication_desired|number|Minimum storage replication level desired for each data block referenced by this collection. A value of @null@ signifies that the site default replication level (typically 2) is desired.|@2@|
|replication_confirmed|number|Replication level most recently confirmed by the storage system. This field is null when a collection is first created, and is reset to null when the manifest_text changes in a way that introduces a new data block. An integer value indicates the replication level of the _least replicated_ data block in the collection.|@2@, null|
|replication_confirmed_at|datetime|When replication_confirmed was confirmed. If replication_confirmed is null, this field is also null.||
