The Go ("Golang":http://golang.org) SDK provides a generic set of wrappers so you can make API calls easily.

h3. Installation

You don't need to install anything. Just import the client like this. The go tools will fetch the relevant code and dependencies for you.

<notextile>{% code 'example_sdk_go_imports' as go %}</notextile>

If you need pre-release client code, you can use the latest version from the repo by following "these instructions.":https://arvados.org/projects/arvados/wiki/Go#Using-Go-with-Arvados

h3. Example

You can save this source as a .go file and run it:

<notextile>{% code 'example_sdk_go' as go %}</notextile>

A few more usage examples can be found in the "services/keepproxy":https://arvados.org/projects/arvados/repository/revisions/master/show/services/keepproxy and "sdk/go/keepclient":https://arvados.org/projects/arvados/repository/revisions/master/show/sdk/go/keepclient directories in the arvados source tree.
