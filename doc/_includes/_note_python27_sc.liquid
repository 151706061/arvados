On older Red Hat-based systems, these packages require the python27 Software Collection.  The Software Collection will be installed automatically as long as Software Collections are enabled on your system.

To "enable Software Collections on CentOS":https://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/SCL, run:

<notextile>
<pre><code>~$ <span class="userinput">sudo yum install centos-release-scl scl-utils</span>
</code></pre>
</notextile>

To enable Software Collections on RHEL, "follow section 2.1 of Red Hat's Installation chapter":https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Software_Collections/2/html/2.0_Release_Notes/chap-Installation.html.

{% include 'notebox_end' %}
