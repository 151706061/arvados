<p>As an admin, you can log in as this user. When you&rsquo;ve
finished, you will need to log out and log in again with your own
account.</p>

<blockquote>
<%= button_to "Log in as #{@object.full_name}", sudo_user_url(id: @object.uuid), class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
</blockquote>

<p>As an admin, you can deactivate and reset this user. This will remove all repository/VM permissions for the user. If you "setup" the user again, the user will have to sign the user agreement again.</p>

<blockquote>
<%=  link_to "Deactivate #{@object.full_name}", { action: 'unsetup', id: @object.uuid }, { confirm: "Are you sure you want to deactivate #{@object.full_name}?", method: 'post' } %>
</blockquote>
