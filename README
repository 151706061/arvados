Sample Arvados web service.

usage: arv-web-example.py [-h] --project PROJECT [--port PORT] --image IMAGE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --project PROJECT  Project to watch
  --port PORT        Local bind port
  --image IMAGE      Docker image to run


This queries an Arvados project and FUSE mounts the most recently modified
collection into a temporary directory.  It then runs the supplied Docker image
with the collection bind mounted to /mnt inside the container.

When a new collection is added to the project, or an existing project is
updated, it will detect the change, it will stop the running Docker container,
unmount the old collection, mount the new most recently modified collection,
and restart the Docker container with the new mount.

The supplied Dockerfile builds a Docker image that runs Apache with /mnt as the
DocumentRoot.  This allows you to browse the mounted collection with Apache's
default index page.


Suggestions for extension:

Configure the container to use mod_passenger (for an example,
arvados/docker/passenger/Dockerfile) and include both your web app and your
data in your collection.
